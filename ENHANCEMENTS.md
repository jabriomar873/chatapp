    # Context coherence
```

#### Hybrid Retrieval System
```python
def create_hybrid_retriever():
    # BM25 keyword search
    # Vector semantic search
    # Score fusion
    # Relevance ranking
```

#### Answer Quality Assessment
```python
def assess_answer_quality():
    # Length scoring
    # Relevance analysis
    # Completeness detection
    # Confidence calculation
```
