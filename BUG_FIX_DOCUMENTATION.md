# 🔧 Bug Fix: "One input key expected" Error

## Issue Description
**Error Message**: `One input key expected got ['context', 'question']`

**What Happened**: The enhanced retrieval system was trying to pass both 'context' and 'question' parameters to the ConversationalRetrievalChain, but the chain expects only the 'question' parameter.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### **Root Cause**
The custom enhanced retrieval function was incorrectly attempting to bypass the chain's built-in retrieval mechanism by passing pre-retrieved context directly.

### **Solution**
1. **Simplified Input Handling**: Modified `handle_user_input()` to only pass the 'question' parameter
2. **Enhanced Retriever Class**: Created a proper `EnhancedRetriever` class that implements the expected interface
3. **Proper Integration**: The enhanced retrieval (hybrid search, quality filtering, etc.) now works through the chain's standard retriever interface

### **What Was Changed**

#### Before (Problematic):
```python
# Trying to pass both context and question
response = st.session_state.conversation.invoke({
    'question': enhanced_question,
    'context': context  # This caused the error
})
```

#### After (Fixed):
```python
# Only pass the question - enhanced retrieval works through the retriever
response = st.session_state.conversation.invoke({'question': enhanced_question})
```

## 🚀 **Enhanced Features Still Working**

All the advanced features are still fully functional:
- ✅ **Hybrid BM25 + Vector Search** - Now properly integrated
- ✅ **Smart Quality Assessment** - Working through the enhanced retriever  
- ✅ **Multi-Query Generation** - Integrated into the retrieval process
- ✅ **OpenAI Integration** - Fully functional with proper parameter handling
- ✅ **Relevance Filtering** - Working seamlessly
- ✅ **Context Optimization** - Based on model type (OpenAI vs HuggingFace)

## 🔍 **How It Works Now**

1. **User asks question** → Enhanced question processing
2. **Enhanced Retriever** → Uses hybrid search and quality filtering  
3. **Chain Processing** → Standard LangChain flow with enhanced documents
4. **Quality Assessment** → Post-processing for answer evaluation
5. **Rich Display** → Enhanced UI with confidence indicators

## 💡 **Prevention & Additional Fixes**

This type of error typically occurs when:
- Custom retrieval logic doesn't match the expected chain interface
- Parameters are passed that the chain doesn't expect
- The retriever interface isn't properly implemented

### **Additional Warning Fixes Applied:**

1. **LangChain Memory Deprecation**: Updated ConversationBufferMemory configuration
2. **BaseRetriever Deprecation**: Ensured proper `_get_relevant_documents` implementation  
3. **Torch Warnings**: Added warning suppression for harmless torch messages
4. **Clean Startup**: Created optimized startup scripts (`start_app.bat`, `start_clean.py`)

The fixes ensure that all enhanced features work through the proper LangChain interfaces while maintaining full functionality and minimal warning noise.

## ✅ **Verification**

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Enhanced retrieval system working properly
- ✅ OpenAI integration functional with quota handling
- ✅ All quality assessment features active
- ✅ User interface displays properly
- ✅ Warning suppression implemented
